## Description
A CMS-style blog site similar to a Wordpress site, where developers can publish their blog posts and comment on other developersâ€™ posts as well. This app follows the MVC paradigm in its architectural structure, using Handlebars.js as the templating language, Sequelize as the ORM, and the express-session npm package for authentication.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage 
Upon landing on the page, the user is presented with a homepage with existing blog posts if there are any. The user may click on any links in the navigation bar to sign up or login. They user may also post to the webpage, and delete posts from the dashboard.

Future development includes adding comment functionality, update post functionality, and styling.


## Credits
While working on this project, I worked alongside Jackson Myhre and Roy Logan in the same bootcamp class. We were provided the models and the views for the entirety of the project. A lot of the routes and front end functionality were taken from class activities and edited to work in this assignment. In addition, I used these links to learn more:
- [res.end()](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/express-js-res-end-function/)
- [$('element[attribute-name=attribute-value]')](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/jqueryexamples/selector_name.htm)
- [multiple handlebar layouts](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30467456/multiple-layouts-with-handlebars-and-expressjs)
